# Privacy Policy


#### Intro
This privacy policy is valid as of 03/22/2021. 

As an application developer and active user on the web, the safety of your personal data and anonymity are very important to me. I do not want your private and even public personal data to be disseminated through this app. I respect your privacy and do my best to avoid any data leak.

Please, note that from time to time, the Privacy Policy may be amended and supplemented.
I will do my best to inform everyone if anything serious will be changed here. Join our Discord guild to be in touch: https://discord.gg/pyaCAXm


#### The data collected by the app
The app does not collect any data that you have entered into the fields.

The only data I collect is information about application errors, crashes, and freezes.
Also, to monitor application usage I collect the amount of sent messages (without any information you have entered, just numbers, nothing more). It is fully anonymously.


#### Data processing
All data that you enter in the app is processed locally on your device and then without any redirects is sent to Discord servers for further processing of the requests in the social network.

All secret tokens and templates are stored locally on your device without sending to any cloud service.

After authorization using a secret bot-token, the app will have full access to the control of the bot and its information.
